          <h1 class="text-primary"><span class="text-secondary">Happiness</span> Month</h1>
          <p>So let's be clear. It is not special. Every day is Happiness Day for all involved in lifecollege.org. 'Special Happiness Month' would be tautological - all is indeed as usual, i.e., not special. Yet, outside, we still find those who seek happiness not, and, therefore, do not find.</p>
          <p>Our learning point: If one holds happiness as a central value in one's life, making it a shaper of destiny, do we need to seek it at all? Should it not always be present?  We are our values.</p>
          <p>To make Happiness Month all it can be, we know one's values need to be 'sharpened' throughout life, to be revisited regularly, ensuring such values are  central to and alive in one's life. Always part of one's destiny, constantly enlivened, sought & always held. Central Values are as one: one's true self, and one's real life. Our Happiness Programme flows through 21 Happiness Activities with you.</p>
          <p>
          So as a Central Value, with lifecollege.org, let us re-aliven happiness through Happiness Month - November, 2021...</p>

              <p>"A GREAT leader makes happen anything they intend and skilfully avoids the unintended through great self knowledge.  Being consciously aware of the potentials and constraints of one’s abilities, yet always being energised by possibilities, is a mark of true leadership. ... Inspired leaders move in that warm milieu comprising great integrity – fairness, honesty, openness – that passion for humanity which pervades all they do.  The potential leader builds the confidence to be great with and through others, and a gentle yet strong self belief and a calling for a balanced greater good which may well manifest through self-created [self-sourced] life purpose.  Their inspiration generates a great internalised equilibrium, an intuitive power; a strong belief and a sense of being which is their source of inspiration within themselves and is manifest so strongly through others: this is leadership."</p>
