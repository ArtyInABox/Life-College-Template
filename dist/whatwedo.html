          <h1 class="text-primary"><span class="text-secondary">Happiness</span> Month</h1>
          <p>So let's be clear. It is not special. Every day is Happiness Day for all involved in lifecollege.org. 'Special Happiness Month' would be tautological - all is indeed as usual, i.e., not special. Yet, outside, we still find those who seek happiness not, and, therefore, do not find.</p>
          <p>Our learning point: If one holds happiness as a central value in one's life, making it a shaper of destiny, do we need to seek it at all? Should it not always be present?  We are our values.</p>
          <p>To make Happiness Month all it can be, we know one's values need to be 'sharpened' throughout life, to be revisited regularly, ensuring such values are  central to and alive in one's life. Always part of one's destiny, constantly enlivened, sought & always held. Central Values are as one: one's true self, and one's real life. Our Happiness Programme flows through 21 Happiness Activities with you.</p>
          <p>
          So as a Central Value, with lifecollege.org, let us re-aliven happiness through Happiness Month - November, 2021...</p>
