           <p>In 2000 we created the Campaign for Adventure www.campaignforadventure.com to protect inspiration, healthy inspiring lifestyles and adventure in society.  "The campaign seeks to show that life is best approached in a spirit of exploration, adventure and enterprise; to influence and better inform attitudes towards being adventurous; to build wider recognition that chance, unforeseen circumstances and uncertainty are inescapable features of life and that absolute safety is unachievable; and to demonstrate that sensible education and preparation enable an appropriate balance to be achieved between risk & safety and achievement & opportunity." HRH Prince Philip is patron of Campaign for Adventure.</p>
           <p>Lifecollege.org sourced Campaign for Adventure, as a charitable foundation, to protect the right of people to try out new experiences - in families, oneself, education, community, enterprise, politics, environment, sports, law, arts, health, fitness, recreation...everything in life! Because successful people always appear willing to find, take and live inspirational risks and adventures. By finding and knowing true their potential people live each amazing moment of their lives in creative collaboration with all their possibilities. This is so right Lifecollege lives it all!</p>
           <p>In May 2015 lifecollege partnered with the Genius Company & the Visionary Network to host the Genius World Conference with the purpose of celebrating social & business innovation.  This event brought together genius innovators from 6 countries -- spanning business, leadership, education, the natural world, technology, social innovation, and more - to innovate a new landscape of business and leadership in the world.  For more information on this event, visit Genius World Conference.</p>
